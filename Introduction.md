### Comparison between New York and Toronto 
## A Data Science Analysis using Foursquare API

# Introduction and Business Problem

Using Data Science methods it is possible to explore the segmentation and clustering of neighborhoods in the world's most important cities of financial and cultural importance. One such analysis that would be of interest is the comparison between New York and Toronto, the main reason being that many multinational corporations, such as Amazon, have recently considered relocating to these locations. Having an understanding of quality of life, and how it may attract high-paid talent to these cities, is of primary importance to these companies when deciding to make a major decision, such as the establishment of a new R&D center. 

This report will aim to compare standard of living for young data scientists that are not yet married by determining the variety and quality of restaurant venues, and how they are grouped within the city. 

# Data 

The data that will be used is drawn from the Foursquare API, and a visual demonstration of restaurant clusters will be presented. Further, a ranking mechanism for neighbourhoods, and a comparison of these ranks between New York and Toronto will be developed and demonstrated.
