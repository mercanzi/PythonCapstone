# Comparison between New York and Toronto 
## A Data Science Analysis using Foursquare API

### Introduction 

Using Data Science methods it is possible to explore the segmentation and clustering of neighborhoods in the world's most important cities of financial and cultural importance. One such analysis that would be of interest is the comparison between New York and Toronto, the two financial centers for North America. By analysing factors having to do with quality of life, and attractivity to talented knowledge workers, it is possible to determine which city would be more attractive to the next generation of employees that the world's most innovative companies need to attract. 


### Business Problem

Multinational corporations, such as Amazon, have recently considered relocating their headquarters or establishing growing secondary headquarters. One of their main obstacles is attracting the talent required to grow their operations to these locations. Having an understanding of quality of life in a city, and how it may attract high-paid talent to these cities, is of primary importance to these companies when deciding to make a major decision, such as the establishment of a new R&D center. This analysis aims to provide a direct comparison between the attractivity of a city to knowledge workers based on quality of life. This report will aim to compare standard of living for young data scientists that are not yet married by determining the variety and quality of restaurant venues, and how they are grouped within the city. 

#### Target Audience 

Major international corporations that are seeking to relocate or establish R&D Centers. Companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Salesforce are primary targets, while secondary targets would be privately held VC funded companies experiencing strong growth such as Palantir and Dropbox. 

### Data 

An understanding of how quality of life attracts high-paid talent to these cities will be developed using data drawn from the Foursquare API, and a visual demonstration of restaurant clusters will be presented. Further, a ranking mechanism for neighbourhoods, and a comparison of these ranks between New York and Toronto will be developed and demonstrated. 

#### Example Data 

An important feature for young talent is the number of different neighbourhoods that can be visited during leisure time in the city they live in. A count of the number of unique neighbourhoods that contain a minimum number of restaurants will be developed. The distance between these neighbourhoods will developed into a feature that represents a travel indicator, i.e. giving the resident the experience of travelling from one area to another (for example from Chinatown (high concentration of Chinese restaurants) to Little Italy (high concentration of Italian restaurants). This restaurant per neighbourhood vs distance to neighbourhoods, is a an important feature in determining how much leisure one can extract from a city.
